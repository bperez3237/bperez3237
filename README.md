# Welcome

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer looking to tackle challenging problems in software engineering. Since college I've had an interest in coding and I've recently completed a Software Engineering course at Flatiron School to pursue coding as a career. 

Currently I work in the Construction industry as a Cost Engineer at a General Contractor. In my career so far I've learned valuable management and business skills that I am excited to bring to my new software engineering career.
